# Banking Back-end Accounting System

HKU ENGG 1340 group project.

## Problem Statement

By the aid of the rapid development of electronic technology over the past few decades, banking has no longer only been to deposit and withdraw money by handing a passbook and queueing in front of counters, but, with modern bank cards and Internet nowadays, banking also includes making purchases and consumptions via settlement network, managing various forms of assets on e-banking, etc. Transactions not only happen just in counters in the banks, but may also take place anytime anywhere. It is absolutely essential for modern banks to incoporate electronized automated accounting system to carry out transactions 7/24. This project aims to build a simple banking back-end accounting system to fulfill such demands.

## Program Features

The program serves as a back-end system of a bank such that customers at the front-end are able to

- Open saving accounts linked with customer identity (KYC ID) and password (PIN)
- Deposit and withdraw cash to/from saving accounts
- Purchase commodities by a bank card associated with a saving account
- Open time deposits
- Receive interests of saving accounts and time deposits
- Trasnfer money from a saving account to another
- Close accounts

For simplicity, instructions are to be given in the form of string in the command-line, and corresponding results will be shown in the command-line as well.
